# Data  structures are used to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures..

# And for storing multiple values we will again use variables..

"""IN-BUILD DATA STRUCTURES"""
# Now in python we have 4-types of in-built data structure..
# LIST
# TUPLE
# DICTIONARY 
# SET..


"""CUSTOM DATA STRUCTURES"""
# STACK
# QUEUE
# LINKED LIST
# GRAPH 

# Around these data structure there are some algorithms like searching algorithms, sorting algo...

"""List"""
# Mutable : changed after creation
# Duplicates : used to store multiple values so duplicates means same value occuring multiple time. list allows this...
# Ordered : List maintains ordered data structure maintains the sequence of elements as they were inserted . This means you can access elements using their position (index)...
# Heterogenous : List have heterogenous nature that means we can have multiple data types inside the list...
