# """OPERATORS"""
# #Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python has several types of operators for different tasks like arthmetic,comparison, logical operations, and more...


# num1= 24
# num2= 2


# Arithmetic operator
# print(num1+num2)  #addition
# print(num1-num2)  #subtraction
# print(num1*num2)  #mul
# print(num1/num2)  #div
# print(num1%num2)  #modulus
# print(num1//num2)  #floor div( it means after result it will convert float value into integer)..
# print(num1**num2)  #exponentiation

# # BODMAS
# print(24+5-7/3)

# Assignment Operators
# a = 12 here assignment operator is =  ....


# Compound assignment operations
# a = 20
# a += 20
# a -= 20
# a *= 20
# a /= 20 and so on......
# print(a)


#Comparison  operator
# >,<,<=,>=,==,!=

# num1 = 14
# num2 = 12
# print(num1==num2)
# print(num1<=num2)
# print(num1>=num2)
# print(num1!=num2)
# print(num1>num2)
# print(num1<num2)


#ASCII
# print(ord("A"))  #65
# print(ord("a"))  #97

# print("ABC">"ACD")  # we cannot compare string with an integer.....


#LOGICAL OPERATOR
# print(123 > 100 and 34 == 34)  # if both are true it will return true.. if any one condition is false it will return false for all....
# print(123 < 100 or 34 == 34)  # if both are false it will return false.. if any one condition is true it will return true for all....
# print(not 34 == 34)   # not operator reverse the condition if it is true the result will be false, if it is false the will be true...


# Questions
#1..
# print(126 > 130)   #false
# print((456 == 456) != (235 == 236))   #True
# print(12 < 10 or 45 == 56 or 69 > 70 or 15 != 13)  #True
# print( True and bool(0))   #false
